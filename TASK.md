### Task Overview

*Project Description:*  
Design and implement mock APIs for a hypothetical online bookstore, then develop a comprehensive automated testing suite for these APIs.

*Objective:*  
Demonstrate proficiency in API design, mocking services, and automated testing through the development of a functional mock API environment and corresponding test automation scripts.

### Components of the Task

#### 1. API Design and Implementation

*API Endpoints to be Implemented:* <br>
•*User Registration:* POST /users/register <br>
•*User Login:* POST /users/login<br>
•*Search Books:* GET /books?search=query <br>
•*Add to Cart:* POST /users/{userId}/cart<br>
•*Checkout:* POST /users/{userId}/checkout<br>

*Tasks:*
•Design the JSON schema for requests and responses for each endpoint.
•Implement these APIs using a mocking framework or tool (e.g., WireMock, Mockoon) to simulate the backend.
•Ensure the mock APIs simply include a successful calls and a plausible errors (e.g., user not found, payment declined).

*Expected Deliverables:*
•API specifications document detailing the endpoints, including request/response formats and any authentication requirements.
•Implemented mock services either as standalone applications or using a mock server.

#### 2. API Automation Testing

*Tasks:*
•Develop automated test cases that validate the functionality, reliability, and performance of the mock APIs.
•Use a test automation framework like pytest (for Python), JUnit (for Java), or Mocha (for JavaScript). Include integration with tools like Postman for API contract testing.
•Create tests to cover positive scenarios, negative scenarios, error handling, and edge cases.

*Expected Deliverables:*
•A set of automated test scripts that can be run to validate each endpoint.
•A Postman collection configured with tests for contract validation that can be manually executed.

### Requirements

*Programming Languages and Frameworks:*
•You may use any programming language and framework; common choices include:
- *Python:* Flask or FastAPI for API mocks, pytest for testing.
- *JavaScript:* Express.js for API mocks, Mocha/Chai for testing.

*Project Structure:*
```
/api-testing-project
  /mock-apis
    /source
    /config
  /tests
    /integration
  README.md
```

*Design and Implementation Notes:*
•Follow RESTful principles in API design.
•Make tests readable and maintainable; they should clearly indicate what aspect of the API is being tested.
•Include error handling and logging in the mock services to simulate realistic application responses.
•Provide comprehensive documentation in the README.md, including how to set up the mocks, run the tests, and configure the CI pipeline.

*Deliverables:*
•Complete source code for the mock APIs.
•Automated test scripts for integration tests.
•Postman collections for manual testing.
•A detailed README.md.

### Evaluation Criteria

•*API Design:* Logical, efficient, and realistic API endpoint design.
•*Code Quality:* Cleanliness, organization, and use of best practices.
•*Test Coverage:* Depth and comprehensiveness of testing including scenarios covered.
•*Documentation:* Clarity, thoroughness, and usefulness of the provided documentation.
